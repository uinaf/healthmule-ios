# HealthMule — Apple Health to Google Drive

Status: implemented v1 contract; physical-device acceptance pending
Target: native iPhone app with a lightweight Apple Watch companion
Runtime: Swift 6, SwiftUI, HealthKit, Watch Connectivity, Google Drive API v3
Minimum deployment targets: iOS 26 and watchOS 26

## Problem

Apple Health's built-in full export is manual, large, and unsuitable for an
ongoing personal fitness project. Build a private iPhone app that reads a small
allowlist of fitness metrics, normalizes them into stable daily JSON records,
and incrementally uploads those records to a user-controlled Google Drive
folder. A separate trusted agent can then ingest the records into a calorie,
weight, and training tracker without receiving unrelated medical data.

## Product principles

- Private by default: no developer backend, analytics SDK, ads, or third-party
  health-data processor.
- Read-only HealthKit access.
- Least-privilege Google Drive access.
- Idempotent incremental sync rather than repeated full exports.
- A missed background run is recoverable the next time the app opens or runs.
- The on-disk JSON contract is the product boundary and must remain stable.

## Requirements

### R1 — HealthKit authorization

Request read access only for:

- Body mass
- Step count
- Active energy burned
- Basal/resting energy burned
- Resting heart rate
- Heart-rate variability SDNN
- VO₂ max
- Sleep analysis
- Workouts

The setup screen must explain each requested type. Request and query only the
currently enabled subset; enabling a new type must return setup to Health access
review before that type is queried. The app must still function when any subset
is denied. It must never request write access.

### R2 — Google Drive authorization

Use Google OAuth with the `drive.file` scope. Do not request unrestricted Drive
access.

On first setup:

1. Sign in with Google.
2. Create an app-owned folder named `Apple Health Sync` in My Drive.
3. Store its immutable Drive folder ID locally.
4. Tell the user they may move that folder anywhere in their Drive; uploads
   continue by folder ID.

If the local ID cache is unavailable, rediscover an app-tagged root across My
Drive without assuming it remains directly under `root`. Accept only a live
folder that still has a My Drive parent, then recover its `daily` child by the
root's immutable ID. Do not create a duplicate tree while that tagged folder is
discoverable.

Store OAuth credentials in Keychain. Provide explicit Disconnect and Reconnect
actions.

### R3 — Daily export contract

Write one file per local calendar day:

```text
Apple Health Sync/
├── manifest.json
└── daily/
    ├── 2026-07-23.json
    └── 2026-07-24.json
```

Each daily file must conform to this schema:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "date": "2026-07-23",
  "timeZone": "Europe/Istanbul",
  "generatedAt": "2026-07-23T18:10:00+03:00",
  "metrics": {
    "weightKg": 82.9,
    "steps": 10432,
    "activeEnergyKcal": 1004.2,
    "restingEnergyKcal": 2016.0,
    "restingHeartRateBpm": 58.0,
    "hrvSdnnMs": 47.5,
    "vo2MaxMlKgMin": 41.2,
    "sleepMinutes": 468
  },
  "workouts": [
    {
      "id": "healthkit-uuid",
      "type": "traditionalStrengthTraining",
      "startedAt": "2026-07-23T07:03:00+03:00",
      "endedAt": "2026-07-23T07:59:00+03:00",
      "durationMinutes": 56.0,
      "activeEnergyKcal": 312.0,
      "distanceMeters": null
    }
  ],
  "totals": {
    "workoutMinutes": 83.0,
    "workoutActiveEnergyKcal": 475.0
  },
  "sources": {
    "deviceNames": ["Apple Watch", "iPhone"],
    "sampleCount": 184
  }
}
```

Rules:

- Missing or unauthorized values are `null`; never invent zero.
- Numeric values use SI/metric units shown in the field names.
- Known decimal measurements are rounded to the nearest value with at most two
  fractional digits, with exact half values rounded away from zero, before
  semantic comparison and encoding. Steps remain integers; `null` and unknown
  future fields are not quantized.
- All timestamps are ISO 8601 with UTC offset.
- Do not include GPS routes, raw heart-rate series, clinical records,
  medications, symptoms, reproductive data, or free-text metadata.
- Preserve unknown future fields when decoding a previously written record.
- Preserve unknown numeric values exactly when their coefficient has at most 38
  significant decimal digits after insignificant leading and trailing zeroes
  are removed. Reject wider values before decoding instead of rounding them.

### R4 — Aggregation semantics

- Steps, active energy, and resting energy: cumulative sum for the local day.
- Weight: latest authorized sample in the local day.
- Resting heart rate and HRV: arithmetic mean of authorized samples in the
  local day.
- VO₂ max: latest authorized sample on or before the end of the local day;
  include `null` when none exists in the selected history window. Include the
  selected carry-forward sample in source provenance without double-counting
  its UUID. Older staged records do not widen the active selected-history
  boundary after the user narrows the range.
- Sleep: sum asleep-stage intervals for the sleep session ending on that local
  date. Exclude `awake` and `inBed`; de-duplicate overlapping intervals. Source
  names and sample counts must exclude earlier sessions read only to identify
  the selected session. Use a bounded look-ahead and do not publish a fragment
  until the maximum inter-fragment gap has elapsed, so a pre-midnight fragment
  cannot also be exported as part of the following day's session.
- Workouts: export each authorized `HKWorkout` once by UUID. Derive daily
  workout totals from the rounded values in the exported workout list.
- Use HealthKit statistics queries for cumulative metrics so multiple sources
  are de-duplicated according to HealthKit semantics.

### R5 — Incremental and idempotent sync

- Keep an `HKQueryAnchor` per sample type in local application support storage.
- Use `HKObserverQuery` to learn that a type changed, then
  `HKAnchoredObjectQuery` to fetch deltas.
- Recompute and upsert the affected local dates.
- For sleep additions, edits, and deletions, also recompute the following local
  date as the bounded plausible session-ending day; preserve the sample's
  direct-date mapping so deletions can apply the same rule after relaunch.
- On every sync, also recompute a rolling three-day reconciliation window to
  capture late sleep, workout, or device synchronization without crossing the
  selected first export day.
- Upsert the existing Drive file instead of creating duplicates.
- A repeated sync with unchanged HealthKit data must produce the same semantic
  record and no duplicate Drive file.
- If upload fails, persist a retry item locally with exponential backoff.
- If artifact bytes are committed but their state revision is not, recover the
  pending revision on the next attempt without requiring a process restart.
- Never advance an anchor past data that has not been durably staged locally.
- Retain a deleted sample's UUID-to-date mapping until the anchor that consumed
  that deletion is durably written.

### R6 — Manifest

Maintain `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "exporterVersion": "1.0.0",
  "timeZone": "Europe/Istanbul",
  "lastSuccessfulSyncAt": "2026-07-23T18:10:03+03:00",
  "earliestDate": "2026-07-01",
  "latestDate": "2026-07-23",
  "recordCount": 23
}
```

Update the manifest only after all daily-file uploads in that sync succeed.

### R7 — Initial backfill

During onboarding, let the user choose:

- Last 30 days
- Last 90 days
- Custom start date

Default to 30 days. Process the backfill in bounded day-sized batches and show
progress. It must resume after interruption without duplicating records.

### R8 — Background behavior

- Enable HealthKit background delivery for the allowlisted data types.
- Register observer queries at app launch.
- Use `BGAppRefreshTask` as a fallback reconciliation trigger.
- Use a background `URLSession` for pending Drive uploads.
- Background timing is best-effort; the UI must never promise an exact schedule.
- Record bounded, privacy-safe receipts for automatic reconciliation
  opportunities and background scheduling outcomes. Receipts prove only what
  the app attempted or observed; they must not imply cadence or future runs.
- Opening the app always triggers a reconciliation and retry pass.

### R9 — User interface

The app keeps **Home** and **Settings** as permanent tabs and exposes four
product surfaces without giving one-time workflows permanent tab weight:

1. **Setup** — a Home drill-in
   - HealthKit authorization state
   - Google connection state
   - Drive folder name and open-in-Drive action
   - Backfill range
2. **Status** — the Home summary and detail rows
   - Last successful sync
   - Latest exported date
   - Pending upload count
   - Per-metric permission/last-sample status
   - Latest automatic activity and its relative time
3. **Sync** — a Home repair and activity drill-in
   - Sync Now
   - Retry Failed Uploads
   - Rebuild Last 3 Days
   - Automatic/background receipts and schedule-request outcomes
4. **Settings**
   - Metric toggles within the approved allowlist
   - Export diagnostics
   - Disconnect Google
   - Reset local sync state

Initial loading must reserve the final layout and must not flash a persisted
failure before bootstrap restores current state. Automatic outcomes remain in
the activity surfaces instead of replacing the app shell with transient error
or success banners. Completed setup steps may collapse; incomplete steps remain
expanded and actionable.

Resetting local state must not delete Drive data without a separate destructive
confirmation.

### R10 — Diagnostics and privacy

- Log only allowlisted sync lifecycle events, counts, durations, and redacted
  error classifications.
- Never log health values, OAuth tokens, file contents, Drive identifiers,
  account identifiers, local paths, or raw HealthKit metadata.
- Provide an in-app Share Diagnostics action that exports redacted JSON.
- Use `OSLog` privacy annotations.
- No telemetry leaves the device except the selected normalized records sent to
  the user's Google Drive.

### R11 — Apple Watch companion

Provide a paired watchOS companion that:

- displays only sanitized readiness, sync activity, last-success time, and
  pending/failure counts;
- combines snapshot freshness, activation, reachability, queue state, and
  request delivery so stale or unreachable data never claims Up to Date;
- shows a waiting or retry state before the first valid snapshot;
- sends Sync Now only when the iPhone is reachable, acknowledges accepted
  requests promptly, and clears obsolete delivery failures after a later valid
  snapshot;
- never stores or receives OAuth tokens, Google account details, Drive IDs,
  exported records, raw health metadata, or health values.

The iPhone remains the sole HealthKit query, local staging, Google OAuth, and
Drive upload owner. Watch requests enter the existing idempotent reconciliation
path and must not create a second sync engine.

## Architecture

[Architecture and privacy boundaries](../ARCHITECTURE.md) owns the current
module and runtime map. The product contract requires deterministic,
Foundation-only aggregation and sync logic, platform adapters for HealthKit,
Google Drive, and Watch Connectivity, and dependency injection that keeps core
tests independent of HealthKit and Google.

## Drive upload rules

- Daily JSON files are expected to stay well below 5 MB; use multipart uploads.
- Search for the file by exact name within the configured parent folder once,
  then cache its Drive file ID.
- Update by file ID on later syncs.
- Treat HTTP 401 as reauthorization required.
- Retry 408, 429, and 5xx with exponential backoff and jitter.
- Do not retry other 4xx responses indefinitely.
- Serialize uploads to prevent two background triggers racing on the manifest.

## Conformance fixtures

Commit language-independent fixtures under `Tests/Fixtures/`:

- `multiple-sources.json`: steps from Watch and iPhone do not double count.
- `overlapping-sleep.json`: overlapping sleep stages produce one duration.
- `missing-permissions.json`: denied metrics serialize as `null`.
- `late-workout.json`: a workout arriving two days late updates that day.
- `timezone-change.json`: travel does not rename already exported dates.
- `idempotent-sync.json`: two identical syncs produce one Drive file.
- `failed-upload.json`: anchor and manifest behavior remain recoverable.

The fixture format may use simplified sample objects rather than archived
HealthKit instances, but expected output must be exact JSON.

## Acceptance criteria

- AC1: A fresh install can authorize HealthKit, connect Google, and create its
  Drive folder without a developer-operated server.
- AC2: A 30-day backfill produces exactly one valid JSON record per local day
  (today minus 29 calendar days through today, inclusive) and one manifest,
  including days whose readable metric values are all `null`.
- AC3: Running Sync Now twice without new data creates no duplicate files and
  does not change semantic record content.
- AC4: New steps or a completed workout update the affected daily file after an
  observer/background/foreground reconciliation.
- AC5: Denying any individual HealthKit type does not block other exports and
  produces `null` for the denied metric.
- AC6: Route data, raw heart-rate series, and non-allowlisted health types never
  appear in exported files or logs.
- AC7: Upload interruption survives app termination and completes on a later
  retry without losing staged data.
- AC8: All aggregation fixtures pass in unit tests without an iOS device.
- AC9: HealthKit authorization, observer delivery, and a real Drive upload pass
  an on-device integration test.
- AC10: `make verify-full` succeeds from a clean checkout with the documented
  Xcode and booted-Simulator setup.
- AC11: A paired Watch truthfully distinguishes missing, stale, unreachable,
  and current phone state; displays only sanitized status; and can request a
  sync while the iPhone is reachable without receiving health or credential
  payloads.
- AC12: The deterministic Simulator harness covers startup loading, active
  sync, visible failure, blocked uploads, automatic activity, setup, settings,
  dark mode, and accessibility text without real health or credential data.

## Constraints

- HealthKit and background delivery must be tested on a physical iPhone; the
  simulator is insufficient for the end-to-end proof.
- iOS controls background launch timing. The app guarantees eventual
  reconciliation, not a fixed export time.
- Google OAuth client configuration and Apple signing entitlements are supplied
  at build time and never committed as secrets.
- The repository and exported schema must not contain a personal email address,
  Drive folder ID, OAuth token, or other user-specific credential.
- Existing exported dates retain their original local-date filenames after a
  timezone change; the rolling reconciliation window uses the current timezone
  only for newly affected samples.

## Non-goals

- Calorie or macro tracking inside the iPhone app.
- Medical advice, diagnosis, alerts, or interpretation.
- Writing any data back to Apple Health.
- Continuous heart-rate streaming.
- GPS route export.
- Android support.
- A hosted backend, multi-user accounts, or public sharing.
- Perfectly timed background synchronization.
- A standalone Watch-to-Drive exporter or Watch-side Google authorization.
