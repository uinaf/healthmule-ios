# Sync store persistence scaling

## Status

`migration-plan-required`

- Date: 2026-07-30
- Production baseline: `925cb27`
- Benchmark implementation: `af54e46`

The current schema remains the production format. This decision requires a
separate reviewed migration plan; it does not authorize a schema change.

## Command

```sh
./scripts/swift.sh run -c release SyncStoreBenchmark
```

The command was run twice from the same clean benchmark source. Each reported
row is the median of three isolated trials. Every trial used a unique temporary
directory, deterministic empty synthetic records, and the public
`FileSyncStore.stageDaily` API. The benchmark read only the byte size of
`sync-state.json` after each stage and removed its temporary directory.

Sanitized environment:

- Apple M5 Pro, arm64
- macOS 26.5.2
- Apple Swift 6.3.3
- release configuration

No hostname, serial number, local path, record body, health value, temporary
identifier, or real export data was captured.

## Results

Run 1:

| Days | Median elapsed (ms) | Final state bytes | Cumulative state bytes |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 30 | 14.733 | 38,027 | 590,535 |
| 90 | 62.928 | 113,927 | 5,187,105 |
| 365 | 657.795 | 461,802 | 84,523,780 |
| 1,825 | 14,048.977 | 2,308,702 | 2,107,915,150 |

Run 2:

| Days | Median elapsed (ms) | Final state bytes | Cumulative state bytes |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 30 | 15.261 | 38,027 | 590,535 |
| 90 | 68.129 | 113,927 | 5,187,105 |
| 365 | 640.246 | 461,802 | 84,523,780 |
| 1,825 | 14,176.319 | 2,308,702 | 2,107,915,150 |

Scaling:

| Range | Day-count ratio | Cumulative-byte ratio | Run 1 elapsed ratio | Run 2 elapsed ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 90 / 30 | 3.000 | 8.784 | 4.271 | 4.464 |
| 365 / 90 | 4.056 | 16.295 | 10.453 | 9.398 |
| 1,825 / 365 | 5.000 | 24.939 | 21.358 | 22.142 |

Final state size is effectively linear at 1,267.57, 1,265.86, 1,265.21, and
1,265.04 bytes per day. Cumulative bytes closely track the square of the
day-count ratios because every stage rewrites all prior artifact state.
Elapsed results varied by at most 7.9% between the two samples and show the same
superlinear curve.

## Correctness and privacy constraints

Any replacement must preserve:

- artifact-first staging and atomic state publication;
- exact local and uploaded revisions plus retry, block, and manifest-refresh
  state;
- cancellation-safe and idempotent recovery after interruption;
- canonical record encoding and semantic equality behavior;
- explicit JSON nulls and unknown record fields;
- iOS file protection and backup exclusion on every persisted component;
- Foundation-only, deterministic `HealthRelayCore` behavior;
- no logs or benchmark output containing record bodies, health values,
  metadata, paths, tokens, or identifiers.

## Alternatives

### Retain monolithic JSON

This preserves the simplest recovery model and requires no migration. It also
retains full semantic and content bytes for every artifact in each atomic state
rewrite. The measured cumulative writes and latency make this unsuitable as the
long-term format.

### Split content bytes from state

Keep a small atomic metadata index while moving per-artifact semantic/content
material to protected sidecars or deriving it from the existing canonical
artifact files. This directly targets the measured amplification while
retaining file-based recovery and avoiding a database dependency. It is the
preferred direction for a state-v2 design investigation.

### Append journal

An append-only journal reduces steady-state rewrites, but introduces replay,
compaction, partial-tail recovery, and bounded-growth contracts. Those new
correctness surfaces need stronger justification than the split-state option.

### SQLite

Transactions and incremental updates address amplification, but add a database
boundary, migration tooling, backup handling, and more operational complexity.
It should be reconsidered only if the file-based v2 design cannot meet
correctness or performance goals.

## Decision

The evidence requires a migration plan. At 1,825 synthetic empty days, the
current store rewrites about 2.11 GB of state and spends about 14.1 seconds in
the staged workload on this machine. Both cumulative bytes and elapsed time are
materially superlinear, and real records can only increase the encoded content
carried in the state file.

The follow-up should specify and benchmark a file-based v2 design that splits
bulk semantic/content bytes from the monolithic metadata index. It must define
the on-disk contract, recovery algorithm, migration states, compatibility
window, corruption behavior, and proof against the current test suite before
production code changes begin. This decision intentionally does not select
sidecar names, digest algorithms, or migration implementation details.

## Rollback and migration constraints

A future plan must:

1. Continue reading schema v1 until a v2 migration has been fully verified.
2. Build v2 state in temporary protected storage and publish it atomically.
3. Preserve the v1 state until every artifact, revision, and retry item has
   round-tripped through v2 validation.
4. Make interruption at every migration step safe to retry without revision
   changes or duplicate uploads.
5. Define how an older app recovers or rolls back after v2 publication; a
   one-way version flip without a compatibility path is not acceptable.
6. Re-run this fixed benchmark and the complete `FileSyncStore` correctness
   suite before the migration can be proposed for release.
