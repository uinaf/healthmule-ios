# HealthMule agent guide

HealthMule exports a read-only allowlist of Apple Health metrics as stable
daily JSON files in the user's own Google Drive. There is no developer backend.
The privacy boundaries in Repo rules are non-negotiable.

## Start here

- Generate the Xcode project: `make project`
- Build and launch in Simulator: `make run`
- Required gate before any push: `make verify`

## Runner contract

- Core tests and `make verify` need only a Swift 6 toolchain and run on Linux.
- Everything that compiles the app or the Watch app needs a full Xcode with the
  iOS and watchOS SDKs.
- Always call the `scripts/` wrappers instead of bare `swift`, `xcodebuild`, or
  `xcrun`. They locate `/Applications/Xcode*.app` themselves, so `make verify`
  and `make build` work even when `xcode-select` points at CommandLineTools.
- `make test`, `make smoke`, and `make run` get no such fallback. They need
  `xcode-select` pointed at a full Xcode.
- `xcrun simctl` and every tool that resolves Xcode through `xcode-select`,
  the Claude Code iOS Simulator MCP included, fail until an operator runs
  `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app`. Use `./scripts/xcrun.sh`
  meanwhile.
- `make test`, `make smoke`, and `make verify-full` boot a cold target and wait
  for it before testing. They shut it down on exit only when that invocation
  booted it; an already-booted Simulator remains running. This avoids the
  `SBMainWorkspace ... Busy` launch race without leaking a headless Simulator.
- XcodeGen is pinned and provisioned into `.artifacts/toolchain` by
  `make project`. Do not install it separately; a different version rewrites the
  whole project file.

## Validation

- Fast contract tests: `make test-core`
- Fast local and required CI gate: `make verify`
- Full iOS and Simulator gate: `make verify-full`
- Runtime smoke test: `make smoke`
- Full command matrix: [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md#validation)

What the gates prove:

- `make verify` checks the infrastructure contract, parses all app and iOS test
  Swift, and runs the deterministic core tests on Linux or macOS. Make runs
  those three independent lanes concurrently with a bounded job count.
- Parsing is not type checking, so app, Watch, and UI changes also need
  `make build` or `make smoke` locally.
- Required CI always runs `make verify` on Linux. It adds `make build` on macOS
  when app, Watch, project, package, build-script, or compile-workflow inputs
  change; documentation-only and unrelated automation changes skip that lane.
- The iOS unit and Simulator UI suites belong to `make verify-full`, which runs
  locally or through the manual `Full Verify` workflow, never on a pull request.

## Repo rules

- Keep `HealthMuleCore` Foundation-only and deterministic.
- HealthKit is read-only. Never add HealthKit write types or entitlements.
- Never log health values, OAuth tokens, record bodies, or raw metadata.
- Preserve explicit JSON `null` values and unknown fields in exported records.
- Keep credentials in `Config/Secrets.xcconfig` and Keychain; neither is
  committed.
- Simulator fixtures are development proof only. HealthKit background delivery
  and real Drive uploads require the physical-device checklist in the docs.
